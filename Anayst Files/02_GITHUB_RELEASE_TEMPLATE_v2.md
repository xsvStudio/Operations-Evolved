# GITHUB ALIGNMENT DIRECTIVE v2
**CRITICAL UPDATE: Phase 2 NOW Includes Electron UI**

**Date:** January 19, 2026, 4:08 AM EST  
**Owner:** Ian Martin (CTO)  
**Status:** CRITICAL - PHASE 2 SCOPE CHANGED

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION FROM OWNER

### What Changed
**Previous Plan (REJECTED):**
- Phase 2 = ZIP file with folders only
- Phase 4 = Build Electron UI later

**New Plan (OWNER APPROVED):**
- Phase 2 = **ELECTRON LAUNCHER with award-winning UI**
- Phase 4 = Add features to existing launcher

### Why This Matters
**The Psychological Hook:**

User expects: "Free templates" (ZIP file)  
User gets: **Professional desktop software ($5,000 look)**  
User thinks: "If FREE looks this good, PAID must be incredible"  

**If we ship ZIP file:** We lose the marketing hook. We look amateur.

**If we ship beautiful launcher:** We WIN. User is impressed. Conversion happens.

---

## SECTION 1: REVISED PHASE 2 SCOPE

### Phase 2 NOW Includes

✅ **Electron Desktop Application**
- Award-winning UI design (Dribbble quality)
- Custom window frame (NO standard OS chrome)
- Dark mode interface
- Smooth animations
- Professional typography and colors

✅ **Setup Wizard / Launcher**
- Welcome screen
- Industry template selection
- Folder deployment interface
- Success confirmation
- Built-in help/documentation

✅ **Python Backend (Hidden)**
- Runs as background process
- User NEVER sees terminal
- Creates folder structure
- Deploys templates to user's drive

✅ **Installer**
- Windows: `.exe` installer
- Mac: `.dmg` installer
- Linux: AppImage
- One-click install

✅ **Templates & Files** (deployed via app)
- 6 industry templates
- 5 master tracking files
- All documentation

### Phase 2 Does NOT Include
❌ Live dashboard features (RFI tracking, alerts, analytics)
❌ File watching system
❌ Multi-project view
❌ Advanced automation

**BUT:** The Electron foundation ships NOW.

## SECTION 2: ENGINEERING TEAM INSTRUCTIONS

### What to Build (Starting TODAY - Jan 19)

**Day 1 (Jan 19):**
- [ ] Create Electron project
- [ ] Set up React
- [ ] Design UI mockups (award-winning quality)
- [ ] Custom window chrome research

**Day 2 (Jan 20):**
- [ ] Build Setup Wizard screens (5 screens)
- [ ] Integrate Python script (hidden execution)
- [ ] Implement template selection
- [ ] Folder deployment logic

**Day 3 (Jan 21 Morning):**
- [ ] Create installers (Windows/Mac)
- [ ] Test install + setup flow
- [ ] Polish animations
- [ ] Final QA

**Day 3 (Jan 21 Afternoon):**
- [ ] **SHIP IT**
- [ ] GitHub release
- [ ] Monitor feedback

### Design Requirements (CRITICAL)

**Visual Quality Bar:** Dribbble/Awwwards level
- Custom window design (no default OS chrome)
- Dark mode default theme
- Premium color palette
- Professional typography
- Smooth micro-animations
- Polished transitions

**Why This Matters:**
This is our marketing funnel. The UI quality IS the product differentiator.

### Technical Stack (Unchanged)
- **Frontend:** Electron + React
- **Backend:** Python (packaged with app)
- **UI Framework:** Custom components (NO generic Bootstrap)
- **Packaging:** electron-builder
- **Distribution:** GitHub Releases

---

## SECTION 3: WHAT STAYS THE SAME

✅ Local-first architecture (no cloud)
✅ User's data on their drive (OneDrive/Google Drive)
✅ Works offline
✅ 6 industry templates
✅ 5 master tracking files
✅ No authentication
✅ No user accounts
✅ Free forever

---

## SECTION 4: AI ASSISTANT GUARDRAILS (UPDATED)

### Rule 1: Phase 2 Includes UI NOW
**Before:** Phase 2 = folders only, no UI
**Now:** Phase 2 = Electron app with Setup Wizard

If you're generating code for Phase 2:
✅ Build Electron UI components
✅ Build Setup Wizard screens
✅ Integrate Python (hidden)
✅ Create installers

### Rule 2: Design Quality is Critical
This is NOT a prototype. This is NOT an MVP hack.

**Requirements:**
- Award-winning visual design
- Custom window chrome
- Professional animations
- Premium feel

**WHY:** The UI quality is the marketing strategy.

### Rule 3: Python Runs Hidden
User NEVER sees:
- Terminal windows
- Console output
- Python loading
- Script execution

User ONLY sees:
- Beautiful Electron UI
- Smooth wizard flow
- Success confirmation

### Rule 4: Timeline is Aggressive
**2 days to build.** This is fast.

**Prioritize:**
1. Working installer
2. Beautiful UI
3. Template deployment
4. Success flow

**Cut if needed:**
- Advanced animations
- Extra screens
- Complex logic

**But don't cut:**
- UI quality
- Core wizard flow
- Python integration

## SECTION 6: WHAT TO TELL TEAM

### For Engineering Team
"Phase 2 scope changed. We're building Electron UI NOW (not later).

This is our marketing hook. User expects ZIP file, gets beautiful software.

Design quality matters MORE than feature count.

We have 2 days. Let's fucking ship."

### For Design Team
"Design a Setup Wizard that looks like $5,000 software.

Think: Dribbble. Awwwards. Premium. Professional.

Dark mode. Custom window. Sleek animations.

This is the FREE version. Make it impressive."

### For Management
"Strategic pivot: Phase 2 now includes Electron launcher.

WHY: Marketing funnel. Visual quality = conversion.

RISK: Aggressive timeline (2 days).

MITIGATION: Cut features, not quality."

### What Success Looks Like
**Reddit comment:** "Holy shit, this UI is cleaner than most paid tools."
**ProductHunt comment:** "Downloaded expecting templates, got legit software."
**GitHub issue:** "When's the paid version? I want more features."

**That's the goal. Visual quality drives conversion.**

---

## SECTION 8: PHASE 4 IMPACT (UNCHANGED)
