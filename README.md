## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I customize the templates?**
A: Yes! After building, all folders are standard file system directories. Edit as needed.

**Q: What if I already have a company folder?**
A: The system will warn you before overwriting. It skips existing folders and logs them.

**Q: Does this work on Windows/Mac/Linux?**
A: Yes! Python and Tkinter are cross-platform.

**Q: Can I run this multiple times?**
A: Yes. Existing folders won't be deleted, only new ones added.
