# Operations Evolved
**Enterprise Folder Structure & Project Management Framework**

---

## What This Is

A proven folder structure system + project tracking templates built from 20+ years managing construction, business operations, and professional services projects.

**Not another project management SaaS.** Not another "productivity hack." This is the actual folder architecture and tracking system that runs real businesses.

---

## The Problem We Solve

Most companies store project files like this:
- `final_final_v3.docx`
- `New Folder (2)/Documents/Random stuff/`
- Email attachments nobody can find
- Google Drive chaos
- "Where did we put that contract?"

**Cost:** Wasted hours searching. Missed deadlines. Compliance failures. Lost revenue.

## The 5-Folder Architecture

Every project follows this base structure:

```
[Project-Name]/
├── 01-Admin/                 # Contracts, insurance, legal
├── 02-Financial/             # Estimates, invoices, payments
├── 03-Planning/              # Schedules, coordination, RFIs
├── 04-Execution/             # Daily work, submittals, photos
└── 05-Closeout/              # Final docs, warranties, handoff
```

**Why 5 folders?**
- Matches project lifecycle stages
- Intuitive for any team member
- Scales from 10-file to 10,000-file projects
- Works for any industry (then customize sub-folders)

## About xsvStudio

Built by Ian Martin and the team at [xsvStudio](https://www.xsvstudio.com) - a web development and business operations firm based in New Castle, DE.

**Why we built this:**
We got tired of watching companies waste hours searching for files, miss deadlines because documents were lost, and fail audits because their folder structure was chaos. So we systemized our own operations, realized it worked for our clients, and turned it into a product.

---

## The Origin Story

Started as an internal project to organize xsvStudio's own operations (web dev + construction services). We needed one system that could handle:
- Web design projects
- Construction contract management
- Client deliverables
- Financial tracking
- Compliance documentation

After 6 months of refinement, we realized: **This works for any project-based business.**

So we're open-sourcing the foundation and building a commercial dashboard on top.

We're shipping fast and fixing faster.
