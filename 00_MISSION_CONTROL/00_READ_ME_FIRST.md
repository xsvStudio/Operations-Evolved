## ⚠️ THREE LOCKED RULES

These **CANNOT BE CHANGED:**

### RULE 1: Phase 2 LOCKED
- Setup wizard + folder deployment ONLY
- NO dashboard, alerts, analytics, premium
- Date is immovable: January 21, 2026
- If pressure to add → CUT FEATURES, NOT DATE

### RULE 2: Repository is xsvStudio ORG
- All code → xsvStudio/Operations-Evolved
- NOT personal account
- NEVER deviate from repo location

### RULE 3: Business Goal FIRST
- Organize construction files in 10 minutes
- $0-500/mo per customer
- Beautiful design = justifies pricing
- If technical complexity grows → simplify
