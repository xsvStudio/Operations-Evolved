Need to review the Start Here and Master Execution directive..


We need to update a DETAILED phase 2 implementation plan in stages.  So the AI assistants dont fuck out alone the way.  This i feel is critical to how we roadmap and build this on code.  If we do not engineer this based on how we are planning to release this feature.  We will fuck this up and later wont be able to do certain things.




# NEED TO ADD ITEMS
Workflows from estimating to approved projects via auto folder / file transfer or creation under the construction services product template and Allstar build.
