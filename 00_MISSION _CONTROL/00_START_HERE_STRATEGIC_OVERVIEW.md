### 2. ENGINEERING MASTER DIRECTIVE (Technical Strategy)

**What we're building:**
```
One App, Three Tiers:
├─ Tier 1: Business Essentials (Free) - Folder structure + templates
├─ Tier 2: Shadow Ops (Light) - Dashboard + basic tracking
└─ Tier 3: Allstar Command (Deep) - Full dashboard + AI insights
```

**Why three tiers?**
- Entry point is free (no friction)
- Easy upgrade path (same codebase)
- Captures customers at different budgets
- Revenue per tier Subscription: $0 → $200/mo → $500/mo
- Revenue per add-on or product: $5 → $5000

**Timeline to production:**
```
Jan 21  → Dashboard v0.1 functional (DEMO READY)
Jan 21 → Phase 2: Folder structure + templates + Dashboard Release to allow users to download and install the "Showcase" bussiness essientials package.  All future services, software, features or addons to be promoted on dashboard and a "Coming Soon" around each clickable option.(SHIP THIS WEEK)
Jan 27 → Phase 4: Dashboard development begins (LIVE WITH ALLSTAR and xsvStudio, LLC)
June 15, 2026 → Production-ready (REVENUE)
```

**Technology Stack:**
- Frontend: Electron + React (desktop app)
- Backend: Python + file watching
- Data: Local-first (user's OneDrive/Google Drive)
- No cloud backend needed (90% cost advantage)

**Success Gates:**
- To be completed later.  Sucess is in the build for xsvStudio and Allstar.  Any sales is a plus.

### 3. EXECUTIVE STRATEGIC SUMMARY (Business Case)

**Market Opportunity:**
- 33 million small businesses in US
- Average spend $200-500/mo on project management
- Procore/Monday.com expensive ($30-50 per user)
- We're 90% cheaper, local-first, faster

**Three Revenue Streams:**

**Stream 1: Freemium Dashboard**
- Free: Business Essentials (folder structure)
- Premium: AI audit ($9.99/mo) - Analyzes folder structure, finds issues
- Revenue: $10/mo per user × 10,000 users = $100K/year
- Add-ons / Products: File Templates.  
   - For whatever we have built for whatever industry or service.  We will release options as we create these documents.  
      - As an example.  Construction Documents, Change Orders and a Tracking Log, RFI's and a tracking log, Job Costing Sheet, Submittal Coversheets, Safety manuals, Standard Contracts, etc..
   - Custom Folder and file naming / coding options.  If the user opts to pay for this product feature when during the BE install, there is a Tab or table or stomething in dashboard the appears or gos to something that allows the user to pick the naming standard format for folders and files prior to download.  Now we also want this to be a drag and drop option in this dashboard.  Where they can move these formating options around by draging and dropping them and finding there favorate format or the one that fits their company.  Or they can just pick any standard options in a dropdown before the "whiteboard" or whatever appears or whatever.

**Stream 2: Dashboard Licensing**  This may be changed before we go live.
- Tier 2 (Light): $200/mo - Project tracking, RFI log, BuilderTrend/Procore ALT
- Tier 3 (Deep): $500/mo - AI insights, predictive alerts
- Revenue: 50 customers × avg $300/mo = $180K/year

**Stream 3: Setup Services**
- Custom folder structure setup: $2,500 per customer
- Training and deployment: $1,500 per customer
- Revenue: 30 customers × $4,000 = $120K/year

**Year 1 Total:** $30-50K (conservative)  
**Year 2 Total:** $150-200K (with 50+ customers)  
**Year 3 Total:** $300K+ (scaling phase)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- 90% cheaper than Procore
- Faster implementation (1 day vs 4 weeks)
- Data stays on user's drive (no vendor lock-in)
- Works offline
- Industry-specific templates (construction, contractors, agencies)

**Go-to-Market:**
1. Phase 2 (Jan 21): Launch on Reddit/ProductHunt - free distribution
2. Phase 4 : Case study from Allstar + sales outreach
3. Phase 5 (June 15): Product Release and company party
