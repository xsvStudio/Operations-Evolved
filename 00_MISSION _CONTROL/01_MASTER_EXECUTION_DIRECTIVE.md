# 🛑 EXECUTION ORDER: THE "LOCAL-FIRST" PIVOT
**To:** Engineering Team, AI Assistants, Product Stakeholders
**From:** Ian Martin, CTO
**Date:** January 19, 2026
**Status:** EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY

## 1. THE STRATEGIC SHIFT
We are cancelling all work on "Tkinter Scripts" and "Web Portals."
We are building a **Unified Desktop Ecosystem** that serves two markets with one codebase.

**The Product Vision:**
We do not sell cloud subscriptions. We sell **Governance**.
We deploy a "Shadow Structure" into the user's existing Cloud Drive (OneDrive/Google Drive). We provide the software lens to manage it.

## 2. THE "ONE APP" ARCHITECTURE
We are building a single **Electron + React Application**.
* It acts as the **Launcher/Installer** (Phase 2).
* It evolves into the **Dashboard** (Phase 4).

**The User Journey:**
1.  User downloads `xsv-essentials.exe`.
2.  **The Hook:** A beautiful, high-polish UI opens. It does NOT look like a script. It looks like a $5,000 Enterprise Tool.
3.  **The Setup:** User clicks "Get Organized." The App creates the folder structure in their OneDrive background.
4.  **The Upsell:** The App stays installed. Later, it unlocks "Audit" and "Dashboard" features (Paid).

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Electron + React
- Backend: Python (hidden process)
- Data: Local folders (OneDrive/Google Drive)

## 3. THE PHASES (Immutable Dates)

### 🟢 PHASE 1: The Roadmap implementation and foundation.
**Foundation** The engine and foundation that this entire project is built on.  The brain that builds the bussiness essiential package and makes it function correctly.  The core of the entire project that needs to be built to scale and meet our end goals.  We need sucess in the beginning or we will fail our own internal companies goals for a manageable filing system, dashboard viewers, and CRM or PM solution as a replacement to BuilderTrend, Procore and Autodesk.  "Owning" your own data, and all the other perks..

The downloader that loads the beautiful dashboard, to the free users that want the file structures to maintain the company.  The specialized or "market" "industry" specific file folder structure.  To the ablility to pick what industry or market you want in the dashboard.  To picking the other features or additions we over in the dashboard.  Then when the lisence or key or free version is installed.  The dashboard updates accordingly.

### 🟢 PHASE 2: THE LAUNCHER (Deadline: Jan 21)
* **Deliverable:** A polished Electron App that acts as a "Setup Wizard."
* **Function:** Asks user "Construction or General?", detects OneDrive or Google Drive, deploys JSON templates.  

#### Every download includes the **Universal Business Base**—the folders every legitimate company needs but forgets to set up:

        | Folder | What Goes Inside |
